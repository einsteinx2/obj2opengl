##obj2opengl - Convert obj files to a C data structure

This is a modified version of the `blender2opengles` tool from this tutorial: https://www.raywenderlich.com/2604-how-to-export-blender-models-to-opengl-es-part-1-3

Original GitHub repo here: https://github.com/ricardo-rendoncepeda/GLBlender1

The tool takes in a `.obj` file exported from Blender (or wherever) and converts it into a C struct containing the relevant data for use in rendering.
